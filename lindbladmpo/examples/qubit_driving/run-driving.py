"""
An example of a large scale research project for the dynamics of qubits with XY (flip-flop) interactions
with different topologies (connectivity), in which an edge qubit is being driven on resonance
in the lab frame, and the qubits have alternating frequencies between nearest neighbors.
The problem is simulated in the frame rotating with the driven qubit's frequency (after a rotating
wave approximation), with the qubits initialized along the z axis of the Bloch sphere
(the pure product ground state), and subject to energy relaxation and decoherence. 
The research results obtained using this code are presented in detail in arXiv:2203.05871.
This paper also explains in detail how to construct and verify numerical results with multiqubit simulations.

Note that both qiskit and qiskit-dynamics packages must be installed if the scipy solver is used
in the following (and invoking scipy with numpy arrays). Some Qiskit code is used also for plotting
the qubits configuration, for both the scipy and MPO solver.
